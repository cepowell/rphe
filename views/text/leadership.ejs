  Our organization, in defiance of the heavily entrenched gender norms of Honduras, was founded by five women. All have equal say in program development and financial decision making. Our regional director, Trudy Hilton, is a product of the community where we hold the majority of our charlas, and she also serves as assistant director of the island’s only HIV clinic. Daniela Brissett, a senior U.S. medical student and soon-to-be pediatrician, has transitioned the majority of her local administrative roles to the Honduran team, and she and the rest of the U.S. team develop reproductive health policy and bring their experience working for similar programs in the U.S. Our Honduran medical students ensure that the program’s curriculum is culturally appropriate and are pivotal in recruitment of volunteers, community partners, and resources.
